Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, returns home to find his father dead and his mother married to his uncle Claudius, who has taken the throne. The ghost of Hamlet's father appears, revealing that he was murdered by Claudius and urging Hamlet to avenge his death. Hamlet feigns madness to investigate and confirm the guilt. He arranges a play reenacting the murder to observe Claudius's reaction, which confirms his guilt. Claudius, now threatened, plots to kill Hamlet, sending him to England with secret orders for his execution. Hamlet escapes, returns, and confronts the morality of revenge during a soliloquy. Meanwhile, Ophelia, Hamlet's love interest, goes mad and drowns after her father Polonius is accidentally killed by Hamlet. Her brother Laertes returns seeking revenge for his father's death. Claudius manipulates Laertes into a fencing match with Hamlet, using a poisoned blade. During the duel, Gertrude drinks poisoned wine meant for Hamlet and dies. Laertes wounds Hamlet with the poisoned sword, but in the scuffle they exchange weapons, and Hamlet wounds Laertes. As Laertes dies, he reveals the king's plot. Hamlet then kills Claudius. Hamlet, dying, names Fortinbras as the new king of Denmark. The play ends with the royal family dead and Fortinbras taking over.
