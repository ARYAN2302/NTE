You are a narrative remapping engine. Your task is to translate the abstract narrative representation into a new world setting while preserving the narrative logic, causal structure, and character roles. IMPORTANT: Ensure the output is valid JSON. Do not omit commas between elements.

Given:
1. The original abstract representation (JSON):
[ABSTRACT_JSON]

2. Target world description:
[TARGET_WORLD]

[WORLD_KNOWLEDGE]

Instructions:
- Remap each element of the abstract representation to the new world.
- Use relational analogy (e.g., "king" -> "CEO").
- If "Extra World Context" is provided above, you MUST strictly adhere to those rules (e.g., if it says "no magic", do not use magic).
- Output the remapped abstract representation in the exact same JSON format as the input.
